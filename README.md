# About The Project
This project aims to tackle the recommendation problem, specifically using a "content-based" approach. The system displays the most relevant suggestions by calculating high cosine similarity measures based on the text input provided by the user.
Leveraging advanced data science techniques such as Word2Vec, Word Embeddings Neural Networks, TF-IDF, and FunkSVD, the system delivers appealing and relevant recipe suggestions. We hope this serves as an excellent foundation for building a robust recommendation engine to inspire food exploration
